# redux-example

This project contains two directories : 

* **asyncredux** - it contains `index.js` file which contains example for dispatching actions in asynchronous way and its corresponding action handler(reducer)
* **syncredux** - it contains `index.js` file which contains example for dispatching actions in synchronous way and its corresponding action handler(reducer)


## Run files

You need to run the individual files under folder **`asyncredux`** or **`syncredux`**.

* If using webstorm/intellij, just right click and run. Make sure to configure node configuration in the IDE(though it gets automatically configured)
* You can also run using **`yarn run start`** and point the start script in package.json to specific files.
